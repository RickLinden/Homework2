# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

## Load the data

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}
skimr::skim(yrbss)

ggplot(yrbss, aes(
  x = weight
)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Answer: We are missing 1004 observations
  
```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

yrbss %>% filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))

```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(
  x = physical_3plus,
  y = weight
)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Answer: There does not seem to be a relationship between these two variables since the weight is pretty similar in all categories. This makes sense because people who do not exercise a lot will probably weigh more because of their fat and people who do exercise a lot will weigh more because of their muscles.

## Confidence Interval

```{r}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
            )

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who donâ€™t.
Null hypothesis: Weight is independent of exercising at least three times a week. 
ALternative hypothesis: There is a relationship between weight and exercisign at least three times a week.

```{r}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```



## Hypothesis test with `infer`

```{r}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

```{r}
null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```



# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

library(generics)
movies1<-movies%>%
  select(c(director,rating))%>%
  filter(director==c("Steven Spielberg" ,"Tim Burton"))


a<-ggplot(movies1, aes(x= rating, y=director, color= director)) +
 geom_point(stat="summary", fun.y="mean", size=5) +

   x = "Mean IMDB Rating"
 ) + theme_linedraw()+
 NULL

a + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15)) +labs(y = NULL)
```


> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

The null hypothesis is that the rating is independent of the director.
The alternative hypothesis is that there is a relationship between rating and director.
We can reject the null hypothesis since the p-value is 0.012 which is smaller than 0.05.

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

Answer:
In this sample size, male's average salary is higher than the female's. Male's 95% confidence interval is also higher than the female's with no overlaps. If we take another sample, we are quite confident that the male's average salary would be higher than the female's in that sample too.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
salary_diff <- omega %>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

salary_gender_null <- omega %>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

salary_gender_null %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = salary_diff, direction = "two-sided")

salary_gender_null %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = salary_diff, direction = "two_sided")
```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

Answer: 
We can refuse the null hypothesis. The mean salaries of male and female are significantly different.

## Relationship Experience - Gender?


```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
experience_diff <- omega %>%
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

experience_gender_null <- omega %>%
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

experience_gender_null %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = experience_diff, direction = "two-sided")

experience_gender_null %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = experience_diff, direction = "two_sided")
```

Answer:
There is a significant difference between the average experience of the male and female executives. But it does not prove the correlation between salary and experience, so it can neither validate nor endanger the previous conclusion.

## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
ggplot(omega, aes(experience, salary)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = "The Relationship between Salary and Experience",
    x = "Experience",
    y = "Salary"
  )
```

## Check correlations between the data

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

Answer:
Salary and experience do have strong correlation and the correlation is higher within female. (CAN'T THINK OF MORE, NEED TO COME BACK)

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

This graph shows the proportion of GDP components in Germany, India, and the US.

In Germany, these proportions have stayed relatively constant over the years. As in the other two countries, Household Expenditure represents the largest proportion of GDP at around 60%. Net Exports have remained around 0%, meaning that Exports were almost equal to Imports. However, since the 2000s Exports have increased, leading to a trade surplus. This could possibly be related to the introduction of the Euro in 1999.

India demonstrates quite some changes in proportion. The share of household expenditure has decreased significantly over the years while the share of gross capital formation has increased. This makes sense because India has developed a lot in the past years and it has been heavily invested in India. Unlike Germany, Net export are mostly below 0, which means that exports are lower than imports and there is a trade deficit.

The US also has a trade deficit, which has increased over the years. It is interesting to see that the share of Government expenditure has decreased in the US while the share of gross capital formation has overtaken the share of Government expenditure.
